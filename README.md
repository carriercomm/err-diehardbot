# Die Hard Bot

This is a silly chatbot plugin for [Err](http://gbin.github.com/err/) which serves up random lines from the film [Die Hard](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/).  Commands are available for getting a random quote from various characters in the film.  Send a `!<character-name>` message to the bot to receive a random line from that character.  A list of supported characters can be received by sending the `!help` command.  For instance, sending `!mcclane` to DieHardBot will return a random line from the McClane character.

The lines are roughly parsed out of the `dieHard.txt` script file which was found laying around on the 'net.
